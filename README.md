# BW Vault

A Bitwarden vault in the [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) bar, powered by the official [`bw`](https://github.com/bitwarden/cli) CLI. Click the padlock, type a few letters, press enter — the password is on your clipboard and you never left the window you're pasting into.

Rewritten in Quickshell/QML from the [bw-tui](https://github.com/keboy/bw-tui) Bubble Tea TUI.

## How it's put together

`bw` is a Node program and a cold start costs about four seconds. That number shapes everything here.

The session, the item list and every `bw` child live in a **service** the shell mounts once and keeps. The dropdown is a view onto it. Opening the dropdown against a warm list costs nothing measurable — filtering 215 items lands well under a tenth of a second, because no `bw` runs at all. Passwords and current one-time codes are fetched only when needed and never enter the list cache.

What that caching does and does not cover is spelled out in [Security notes](#security-notes). The short version: item *metadata* now outlives the panel; passwords and one-time codes do not.

## Features

- **Bar dropdown** — lock state at a glance; click for a search box over your vault. Enter copies the password. `ctrl+u` copies the username with no `bw` call at all, because the username is already in the cached list.
- **Item detail** — `ctrl+enter` opens the selected item: username, password (hidden until you press `p`), current TOTP code when configured, URI, and notes.
- **Master-password unlock** — in the dropdown. The password travels through the child process environment (`bw --passwordenv`), never argv, and its environment is cleared when the child exits.
- **API key authentication** — authenticates with your [personal API key](https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/) (`bw login --apikey`), which needs no interactive 2FA and skips new-device verification. Stored once per machine by `bw-vault-setup`; see [Setup](#setup).
- **Session persistence** — the session key is mirrored to the OS keyring (Secret Service via `secret-tool`), so the master password is asked for once per machine and survives a shell restart.
- **Idle cache expiry** — the cached list is forgotten after `cacheTtlMinutes` of no vault activity (15 by default). The session is untouched, so recovering costs one `bw list` and no master password.
- **Clipboard protection** — credential copies use Wayland's sensitive-data hint and are wiped about 20 seconds later, but only if the clipboard still holds the value this plugin copied.
- **Native Omarchy theming** — built on `Panel`, `KeyboardPanel`, `TextField` and `Color.*` tokens, so it matches your theme.

### Scope

Read and copy only. It does not create, edit or delete items, and it does not cover attachments, organizations/collections, or multiple accounts. Use the official apps for those.

## Install

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/flathack/bw-vault.git --enable
```

`--enable` puts the padlock in your bar and asks which section. Without it, run `omarchy plugin enable com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault --section right` afterwards.

For an install pinned to the reviewed 2.2.0 release, add it without enabling,
detach the clone at the immutable release tag, then enable it:

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/flathack/bw-vault.git
git -C ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault checkout --detach v2.2.0
omarchy plugin enable com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault --section right
```

`omarchy plugin update` returns to the repository's moving default branch and
therefore requires a fresh review.

> If the plugin already has a `plugins[]` entry in `shell.json` from an earlier version, `omarchy plugin enable --section right` will report "Enabled and moved" and change nothing. Remove that entry first; the `bar.layout` entry keeps the service enabled on its own.

## Setup

Once per machine, store your Bitwarden personal API key:

```sh
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault/bin/bw-vault-setup
```

It prompts for `client_id` and `client_secret` (get them from the web vault: Account Settings → Security → Keys → View API Key) and writes them to your OS keyring. The secret is read with terminal echo off and piped to `secret-tool` on stdin, so it never appears on screen, in scrollback, or in the process list.

`--show` reports whether a key is stored without printing the secret; `--clear` removes it.

**Why a terminal command and not a screen in the plugin.** You copy the two values out of a browser one at a time, and an Omarchy bar dropdown dismisses on any click outside it — the trip back to the browser for the second value would close the form and lose the first. Version 1.x solved this with a floating overlay card that deliberately did not grab the keyboard. Dropping the overlay meant dropping that trick, so the key entry moved somewhere that has never had the problem.

If `bw` is already logged in by some other means, you can skip this entirely: the dropdown will ask for your master password and unlock against the existing login.

## Usage

Bind the dropdown in `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`:

```lua
o.bind("SUPER + B", "Bitwarden vault", "omarchy-shell bw-vault-bar toggle")
```

Or click the shield in the bar. **Right-clicking** it locks the vault.

Locking is worth its own binding too — `ctrl+l` inside the dropdown only reaches you while the dropdown is open:

```lua
o.bind("SUPER + ALT + B", "Lock vault", "omarchy-shell com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault lock")
```

It can also be opened with the search line already filled in — useful from a script, or a per-site keybinding:

```sh
omarchy-shell bw-vault-bar search github
```

`search` only filters metadata that is already in the shell process. Nothing in the IPC surface reads, fetches or copies a secret: a password always costs a keystroke on a panel someone is looking at.

### Keys

**Search list**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `type` | Filter items |
| `↑` `↓` | Move through results |
| `enter` | Copy the password (one `bw get`, about four seconds — the panel says it's fetching) |
| `ctrl+u` | Copy the username (instant; already in the cached list) |
| `ctrl+enter` | Open item detail |
| `ctrl+l` | Lock the vault |
| `esc` | Close |

Clicking a row copies its password; right-clicking a row opens its detail.

**Item detail**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `p` | Reveal / hide the password |
| `c` | Copy the username |
| `y` | Copy the password |
| `o` | Copy the current one-time code |
| `r` | Refresh the one-time code |
| `ctrl+l` | Lock the vault |
| `esc` / `←` | Back to the list |

**Unlock**

Type your master password and press enter.

### Settings

Set these through Omarchy's bar widget settings, or directly on the widget's `shell.json` entry.

| Setting | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `maxResults` | `8` | Rows shown in the dropdown |
| `cacheTtlMinutes` | `15` | Forget the cached item list after this many idle minutes. `0` keeps it until you lock |
| `lockOnRightClick` | `true` | Right-clicking the bar icon locks the vault |
| `showCount` | `false` | Show the item count next to the bar icon |

## Upgrading from 1.x

Version 2.0 removes the fullscreen overlay. Two things change for you:

1. **Your keybinding.** `omarchy-shell shell toggle com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault` no longer resolves to anything. Use `omarchy-shell bw-vault-bar toggle`.
2. **First-run API key entry** moved from the overlay's floating card to `bw-vault-setup`. A key already in your keyring is picked up as-is; nothing to redo.

Item metadata is now cached between opens where 1.x dropped it on every close — see [Security notes](#security-notes) if that matters to you.

## Requirements

- [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) 4 (Quattro)
- [`bw`](https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-cli/) — the Bitwarden CLI
- [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — reduces Bitwarden responses before they enter the shell process
- `libsecret` (`secret-tool`) — OS keyring access
- `wl-clipboard` (`wl-copy`, `wl-paste`) — clipboard

These are usually already present on Omarchy. If one is missing, add it with your usual package tooling — the plugin never installs anything itself, and never invokes a package manager.

## Troubleshooting

- `bw: command not found` → install the [Bitwarden CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-cli/).
- `jq: command not found` → install `jq`.
- `secret-tool: command not found` → install `libsecret`.
- The padlock isn't in the bar → `omarchy plugin list`, and see the note under [Install](#install).
- The dropdown says "Not set up" → run `bw-vault-setup`.
- Everything feels slow → that's `bw`. Check `cacheTtlMinutes` hasn't been set to something tiny; each expiry costs one four-second `bw list`.

## Remove

```sh
omarchy plugin disable com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault
omarchy plugin remove com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault/bin/bw-vault-setup --clear   # before removing, if you want the keyring entries gone
```

## Security notes

- The client_id and client_secret are stored in your OS keyring via `secret-tool`, never in a plaintext file, and are passed to `bw login --apikey` through the child process environment rather than argv. The master password is held only while an asynchronous keyring lookup or authentication child needs it, then cleared on every success and failure path.
- Credentials handed to `bw login` / `bw unlock` have that environment cleared when the child exits, on both the success and failure paths. Before 2.0 the master password stayed set on the Process until the next unlock overwrote it.
- **Item metadata is cached between opens, and that is a real change from 1.x.** A short-lived helper reduces `bw list` output to names, usernames, ids, types and URIs before it enters the long-lived QML process. Passwords, notes and other Bitwarden fields never enter the service's list buffer. The metadata lives until you lock or `cacheTtlMinutes` of idleness passes. If you would rather have the old behaviour at the cost of a four-second wait per open, set `cacheTtlMinutes` to 1; the session is unaffected either way.
- Item passwords are fetched on demand through the same field-limiting helper. Reads are serialized, so a delayed response cannot be attributed to a newer selection. The password is separated from item metadata before the service emits it, and temporary process buffers and `BW_SESSION` environments are cleared after each request. The widget retains a password only while its detail screen is showing it.
- TOTP seeds never enter QML. The detail helper emits only a `hasTotp` boolean; a separate `bw get totp <id>` invocation asks the official Bitwarden CLI to calculate the current code. The displayed code is cleared when detail closes or the vault locks and refreshes every 30 seconds while visible.
- The detail screen is the only place a secret is drawn. Passwords remain masked until you press `p`; one-time codes are shown directly because they are short-lived. A bar dropdown sits in the open — remember that before opening an item during screen sharing or a meeting.
- Vault-controlled strings are forced to plain-text rendering; item names, usernames, notes and URIs cannot inject QML rich-text markup.
- A `bw list` started before a lock cannot repopulate the cache after it: in-flight children carry the generation they started in and drop their results if it has moved.
- Password and username clipboard writes carry `wl-copy --sensitive`. The timed wipe compares a digest first, so it does not erase a newer clipboard value owned by another application.
- The session key is stored in the OS keyring. If that fails, it is held in memory only and lost on shell restart.
- QML and JavaScript strings are managed memory: clearing a property removes the application's reference but cannot promise byte-for-byte zeroization before garbage collection. The implementation minimizes fields and lifetimes rather than claiming secure erasure.
- This plugin runs unsandboxed in your shell process, like all Omarchy plugins. It has access to your session and can run arbitrary commands. Review the source before trusting it.

## Development

```sh
omarchy plugin validate .
omarchy restart shell
```

```
manifest.json        # plugin manifest (id: com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault)
Service.qml          # session, item metadata, every bw child. Mounted once by the shell
BarWidget.qml        # bar icon + dropdown: unlock, search, copy, detail
VaultModel.js        # bw CLI command building + JSON parsing (pure JS)
bin/bw-vault-setup   # one-time API key storage, from a terminal
bin/bw-vault-query   # short-lived field-limiting wrapper around bw list/get/totp
test/run             # deterministic unit, contract, fixture and lint checks
test/demo            # run the dropdown against a fixture vault, in its own shell
test/demo-vault.json # the fixture vault
test/fixtures/       # stub `bw` and `secret-tool`
```

### Running it without a real vault

```sh
test/run
test/demo              # starts locked, on the first-run screen
test/demo --unlocked   # starts with the fixture vault open
```

This launches a second Quickshell instance with its own minimal bar, so the running Omarchy shell is untouched. `PATH` is prefixed with `test/fixtures`, whose `bw` and `secret-tool` stubs answer from `test/demo-vault.json` and a temp directory — **`secret-tool` is stubbed as well as `bw`, because otherwise a fixture unlock would write its fake session over your real one in the keyring.** No real vault, keyring or network is involved.

Drive it over its own IPC socket rather than by typing into it:

```sh
qs ipc -p <config-dir-printed-at-startup> call bw-vault-bar search git
BW_DEMO_SCRIPT=detail:github test/demo --unlocked   # open straight onto an item
```

The screenshots in this README were taken that way.

Live state, with no secrets in it:

```sh
omarchy-shell com.aktivesolutions.bw-vault state   # the service
omarchy-shell bw-vault-bar status                  # the dropdown
```

Three Omarchy quirks that will cost you an hour if you meet them cold:

- A **new** `.qml` file in a plugin directory fails to load with `File name case mismatch` until the shell restarts — the QML engine caches the directory listing at startup. Hot-reload only covers files that already existed.
- A **new** `ipcTarget` also needs a shell restart to register, and after a hot-reload the *stale* instance keeps the old target: you get `Handler was registered but will not be used`, and IPC calls land on a widget that is no longer on screen.
- `omarchy plugin enable --section right` silently does nothing if the plugin already has a `plugins[]` entry in `shell.json`.

After editing, `omarchy restart shell` rather than trusting hot-reload.
